# ElecCalc

Early prototype for TUMJA: Team Climates calculator project

Installation (Linux/ MacOS only, good luck on Windows):

1. Install Anaconda according to you OS
2. Install conda environment:  
    `conda env create --file eleccalc_env.txt`
3. Activate conda environment:  
    `conda activate eleccalc`
4. Clone GitHub repository (make sure you're in the directory you want to have the project):  
    `git clone https://github.com/AlexHls/ElecCalc.git`
5. Change into the main directory (should contain a manage.py file)
6. Start the local server:  
    `python managy.py runserver`
7. If everything worked, you should see an adress in your command line output (something like localhost:8000). Click on it or paste it into your browsers adress line
8. Enjoy!
