        <p><b>Information about the internet presence</b></p>
        <p><b>Log-Files</b></p>
        <p>When you access this or other web pages, you transmit data to our web server via your Internet browser. The following data is recorded during an ongoing connection for communication between your Internet browser and our web server:</p>
        <ul>
            <p>●	Complete IP address of the requesting computer</p>
            <p>●	Date and time of the request</p>
            <p>●	Amount of data transferred.</p>
            <p>●	Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)</p>
            <p>●	Web browser and operating system used</p>
            <p>●	Name of the requested file</p>
            <p>●	Page from which the file was requested</p>
        </ul>
        <p>The processing of the data in this log file is done as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <p>●	The log entries are continuously evaluated automatically in order to detect attacks on the web servers and respond accordingly.</p>
            <p>●	In individual cases, i.e. in the event of reported malfunctions, errors and security incidents, a manual analysis is carried out.</p>
            <p>●	Log entries older than seven days are anonymized by shortening the IP address.</p>
            <p>●	The anonymized logs are used to create access statistics. The software used for this is operated locally by the LRZ.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>The IP addresses contained in the log entries are not merged by the LRZ with other databases, so that the LRZ cannot draw any conclusions about individual persons.</p>
        <p><b>Cookies and similar technologies</b></p>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile devices when you visit our website. Various information flows to us through the setting of the cookies.</p>
        <p>In addition to cookies, some services use so-called “local storage entries”. A local storage entry is functionally comparable to cookies, the difference being that with local storage, information is stored in your browser’s cache. Insofar as services on our website use local storage, we expressly point this out in this data protection declaration.</p>
        <p>In addition, some services also use so-called “tracking pixels”.</p> 
        <p><b>Essential cookies</b></p>
        <p>For the proper operation of our internet presence and the proper display of the contents, certain cookies are technically necessary to be able to show you our internet offer at all. These “essential cookies” cannot be deselected, because without them our internet presence cannot be offered. Some cookies are “session cookies.” Such cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your browser session.</p>

If the purpose of the data collection is to make the data accessible to other members of the TUM, the principle of data economy will be observed.

        <p>Your personal data will be deleted after the purpose has been fulfilled unless you have given your consent to further contact.</p> 
        <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 letter a) DSGVO. You can revoke your consent at any time for the future. The legality of the data processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation is not affected by this. To do so, please contact it-support(at)tum.de.
