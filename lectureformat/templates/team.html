        <h2>
            As part of the scholarship program “TUM: Junge Akademie” of the Technical  University of Munich, our project started in 2020, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. Unsatisfied with online teaching formats at the time and curious about how their carbon footprint compared to onsite formats, we decided to investigate the energy consumption of lectures at TUM.  
        </h2>
        <h2>
            We are specifically interested in finding out what hybrid format between online and on-site lectures maximizes the energy efficiency of university teaching, and how our institution can reduce its impact on the planet in this disruptive situation.
