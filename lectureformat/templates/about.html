            <h1> Our Motivation.</h1>
            <h3>Coming from seven different fields of study, we have always been motivated by the desire to act against climate change through our academic knowledge. By creating elecTUM, we were able to combine our different skills to inspire the university, which unites us all, to go one step further in the direction of reducing its carbon footprint.

              <h1> Our Process.</h1>
              <h3>To help our university reduce its carbon footprint, we decided to investigate the energy consumption of lectures and based on that, develop suggestions on how to reduce such consumption. Being in the apex of online lectures, we chose to focus on the energy consumption of online lectures in comparison to those in presence. Since then, we developed a calculator, which takes into consideration several sources of energy consumption during lectures, such as the use of electronic devices or the lighting of the workspace. Parallel to that, we gathered publicly available and TUM-internal data on these parameters. Finally, we conducted a survey for TUM students to take their behavior into account when analyzing the average energy consumption during lectures at our university.
